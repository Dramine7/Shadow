The past 100 years have been really mysterious for the US... Over 1100 people dissappeared in national parks without traces (mainly children younger than 10 years old) and this is especially strange as those places are usually closely watched by law enforcements.\n\n2. In 2003 an old Boeing 727 disappeared entirely. It made an unauthorized takeoff towards the Atlantic Ocean and it was never found again. Even after the FBI, CIA and various US departments investigated.\n\n3. In 1927 a 4 year old Billy Gaffney was left to play in a hallway with a buddy. After their disappearance his buddy was found on the roof with the explanation that the boogey man took them. Serial killer Albert Fish (who fit the description) confessed to Billy's murder years later, yet his body was never found.\n\n4. You probably heard of the horror movie Leatherface? It is actually based on a true story of an American murderer and body snatcher Edward Gein (gein, gei, gay. lmao sorry). He snatched various bodies from graveyards and killed two women to mutilate them and use their skin, genitals etc. to build various things or add them to a collection.\n\n5. You've probably heard of the Bermuda Triangle. In 1918 one of the Navy's biggest fuel ships (USS Cyclops) set out to sail from Brazil to Baltimore. The ship was never heard from again. There was no distress signal.\n\n6. In 1888 a three-month period of terror unleashed upon Londo with the notrious serial killer Jack the Ripper. His victims (mostly heavy drinkers and prostitutes) all has their throats slashed and most had their stomachs slit and organs ripped out. Despite every effort (even from Scotland Yard) nobody every found the identity or motive.\n\n\nIntriguing... isn't it? Or as Vincen van Gogh would say: Normality is a paved road: It's comfortable to walk, but no flowers grow.");
